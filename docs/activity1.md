# Workshop Activity 1: 

## Setting Up the Git Repository and Docker Environment

### Objective:

By the end of this activity, you will have cloned the workshop's git repository and created the Docker environment to run a Learning Platform.  We will be using an opensource Learning Management Platform (LMS) called Moodle.  During this Bootcamp we will develop an LTI Tool that will integrate into any mainstream LMS platform via LTI 1.3.

### Prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of Git and Docker.
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
- Access to modify the local `/etc/hosts` file (administrator privileges may be required).

---

### **Steps to Follow:**

#### 1. **Clone the Git Repository**

Start by cloning the workshop repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1EdTech/LTI-bootcamp-python.git
```

This will download all the necessary files, including the configurations for the Docker environment.

#### 2. **Navigate to the Environment Directory**

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the `environment/` directory where the Docker configuration files are located.

```bash
cd environment
```

#### 3. **Check the Docker Compose File**

In this step, take a look at the `docker-compose.yml` file, which defines the services for running Moodle, the proxy server, and the database. Open it in your favorite text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, or a code editor like VS Code).

```
Open docker-compose.yml in your Code Editor
```

Ensure that the file includes services for:
- **Moodle** (Moodle Docker image)
- **MariaDB** (Database service)
- **Nginx** (Proxy server with SSL certificates)

You should also see the environment variables set for Moodle and MariaDB in this file.

**Note:**  This is just a local development project and is not production-ready.  Please do not use this in production.

#### 4. **Verify the Nginx Configuration**

Open and review the `nginx.conf` file to confirm that it correctly handles SSL for `platform.ltitraining.net` and `tool.ltitraining.net`.

```
Review nginx.conf in your code editor
```

This file includes SSL configurations for the Moodle platform and the LTI tool, routing traffic via the reverse proxy.

#### 5. **Update the Local Hosts File**

In this setup, we will use 2 real domains with real (browser-trusted) SSL certificates.  We will configure the routing on your PC to route these domains locally within your machine.  This allows us to focus on LTI development without the complexities of browser security getting in the way.

To ensure that the domains `platform.ltitraining.net` and `tool.ltitraining.net` resolve to your local environment, you need to update your local `/etc/hosts` file.

##### **On macOS/Linux**:
1. Open the `/etc/hosts` file in your text editor with administrator privileges:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/hosts
   ```

2. Add the following lines to the file:

   ```bash
   127.0.0.1 platform.ltitraining.net tool.ltitraining.net
   ```

3. Save and close the file.

##### **On Windows**:
1. Open Notepad as an administrator (right-click and choose "Run as Administrator").
2. Open the `hosts` file located at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
3. Add the following lines at the end of the file:

   ```bash
   127.0.0.1 platform.ltitraining.net tool.ltitraining.net
   ```

4. Save and close the file.

This step ensures that your browser correctly resolves these domains to your local machine when you access them.

#### 6. **Start the Docker Environment**

Once youâ€™ve reviewed the configurations, start the Docker containers using Docker Compose. This will spin up Moodle, MariaDB, and Nginx services.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will:
- Build and start all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- Run the services in detached mode (`-d`), so they run in the background.

#### 7. **Check the Running Containers**

To verify that everything is running correctly, check the status of the Docker containers.

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see the Moodle, MariaDB, and Nginx services running.

#### 8. **Access Moodle**

Open your browser and access Moodle using the following URL:

```
https://platform.ltitraining.net
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the Moodle login page or the platform's homepage.

You should be able to login using the default username and password;

- user:  user
- password: bitnami

---

### **Troubleshooting:**

- **Containers not starting**: If the containers fail to start, check the logs with the following command:

  ```bash
  docker-compose logs
  ```

  Look for any error messages that indicate issues with the configuration or missing dependencies.

- **Cannot access platform.ltitraining.net**: Ensure that the `/etc/hosts` file is correctly set to resolve `platform.ltitraining.net` and `tool.ltitraining.net` to `127.0.0.1`.

- **SSL issues**: If you run into SSL certificate issues, ensure that the certificates in the `certs/` folder are correctly mapped in the `nginx.conf` file.

---

### **Activity Summary:**
You have now cloned the repository, updated your hosts file, started the Docker environment, and accessed Moodle via the `platform.ltitraining.net` domain. You are ready to move on to the next activity, where you will configure the Moodle LTI tool and begin developing.
